			<font color="black" face="Arial" size="4">The world without Festivals will just become a jungle where we lead a monotonous life. Festivals in India are much larger than almost any occasion. We consider them the best part of the year and wait for them eagerly. People of all ages and economic conditions find their ways to enjoy with their families and worship the gods and goddesses. Festivals are the oldest rituals and traditions our countrymen follow to pay tribute to the almighty gods and goddesses. In fact, these celebrations are nothing but the symbols of peace and happiness. India is a diverse country with multiple religions and cultures conglomerated in a single form. This is why our Festivals draw a unique picture for the rest of the world to follow as a brilliant example of harmony.</font>

			<font color="black" face="Arial" size="4">The most prominent religious Festivals that we celebrate are Dussehra, Durga Puja, Eid-Ul-Fitr, Holi, Christmas etc. These are considered to be the prime religious Festivals of India. The states celebrating these Festivals get decorated like a new bride. New colourful dresses and tasty things to eat are the prime attractions for kids. During this time of the year, people of all ages and economic stature unite at a single place to worship the gods and goddesses.</font>
