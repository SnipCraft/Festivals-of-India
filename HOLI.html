        Holi is the festival of colours which is celebrated not only in India but all across the world. It is also a festival of unity as it brings people together to celebrate a festival regardless of caste, ethnicity or religion. Holi is celebrated for two days in India on the full moon day in March. People celebrate “Holika Dahan” on the first day by gathering around and burning piles of wood and cow dung, and singing bhajans related to Holi.Then on the next day, people of all ages gather together to play with colours called “gulal” and coloured water called “Dulahandi”. People feast together and eat special sweets made for the day called “gujiya” and serve “thandaai” or cold drinks and “bhaang”. But Holi should be played carefully. The gulal used should be prepared organically as chemical gulal may cause irritation to the skin and wherever it comes in contact. People should be aware of their surroundings while playing Holi and be careful not to cause harm to anyone.In some places in India, Holi is celebrated for five days as well. Holi is a national Holiday and all educational institutions and offices are closed on this day.

        There is a mythological story associated with the celebration of Holi. It is said that a cruel king named Hiranyakashipu was blessed by Brahma that no human or animal could kill him on the ground at home or outside. But he was a torturous king and wanted everyone in his kingdom to worst him as a god, and so he ordered the execution of his only son Prahlad by his sister Holika by inciting fire because he was a faithful devotee of Lord Vishnu and Holika was blessed that she wouldn't be touched by fire.It is said that it so happened that on the day of this heinous act, Holika sat on a pile of burning woods with Prahlad on her lap but instead of Prahlad getting burnt, he was saved by Lord Vishnu and Holika turned into ashes. Then Lord Vishnu turned himself into half-animal, half deity form and killed Hiranyakashipu by tearing his stomach apart. Hence, the celebration of Holi has been a mark of triumph of Good over Evil.
